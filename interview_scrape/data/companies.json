Discuss what you have learned about Amazon's fulfillment and delivery network while showing enthusiasm for the process and genuine excitement to learn more.", "\"Amazon has introduced many incredibly advanced supply chain management practices that have led to its domination of online retail and e-commerce offerings. From my research and understanding, Amazon outsources its inventory management tasks while insourcing logistics. Third-party sellers account for more than half of Amazon's sales, and other products that are not ordered as frequently are not stored in Amazon warehouses. The company's same-day and now 2-hour shipping service is possible because Amazon cut out third-party carriers as much as possible. Amazon primarily relies on its own delivery vehicles for these same-day shipping options. Dividing warehouses by delivery options is an important point for me to note, as well. By having different warehouses for Prime, one-day delivery, and more, Amazon can streamline its operations and prevent delivery challenges that commonly cause delays for its competitors. I am excited to learn more about Amazon's unique efforts for meeting customer needs while continually changing the way we approach logistics.\""]}, {"topic": "Area+Manager", "question": "As an Area Manager, you will coach and develop a team of associates in a distribution warehouse environment.

The interviewer wants to know that you will come to the role equipped to succeed in a distribution warehouse environment.

The work was perfect for me as I was a student, and the hours were primarily evenings and weekends. Over those 4 years, I learned about accurate unit picking and how to perform proper order audits for quality assurance. After completing college, I was promoted to floor lead. I have been in this position for two years, working hard to ensure safety and compliance among a team of 50 warehouse workers. I coach on occupational health and safety and also work with team members to gain their forklift certifications.

In simple verbal terms, I would explain that when a customer buys a product online, the fulfillment process begins. The product is on a warehouse shelf, and when the customer places their order, a warehouse employee or a robot picks the product from the shelf, boxes it up, and then the box gets shipped. In the case of Amazon, the company handles the entire fulfillment process, including charging the customer's credit card, updating inventory levels on the website, sending automated shipping email alerts, and handling customer refunds.

The Second Mile, or the Middle Mile as it's sometimes called, is the supply chain stage where products are shipped from the warehouse directly to a retail store. The Last Mile team is responsible for getting the packages from the delivery station to a customer's doorstep. I have read that Amazon is putting a lot of effort into speeding up customer delivery times which is another factor that helps set Amazon apart from any other organization in the world.

It's an incredible way for Amazon employees to explore their interests while significantly boosting their wages once the training is complete. Knowing the foundation Amazon already has, I would heavily encourage my Associates to explore their options. If I could create any new recognition program, I would focus on the floor level and introduce an initiative that was more in the moment for my team members during their daily activities. I especially like the idea of a recognition-based system focused on various performance objectives such as quality of work, performance speed, focus on safety, and teamwork.

I really liked that idea and think it aligns well with my customer service philosophy to always keep an eye out for opportunities to impress. For instance, I currently work part-time as a server for Restaurant ABC. I deliver excellent customer service by introducing myself to each table when I seat them. Having that small personal touch often makes all the difference for my customers. Once they know my name, and I know theirs, they feel more comfortable and ready to relax for a good time with their family and friends.

The Amazon hiring manager might start with a question about what your favorite language is and then move to your approach and possibly your methodology or reasoning for favoring that language. Let me give an example of how this question might be answered. If we intend to use Java for this example, we would look at the LRU cache and recently used entries, then remove the element from the bottom and add an element to the start of a LinkedList; wherever any entry is accessed, it is moved to the top so that recently used entries will reside at the top, and the least used entries will reside on the bottom.", "\"The way I approach implementing an LRU Cache is really based on what programming language is used in the development environment.

Java seems to be a tool of choice in most development environments, and for me as well. Say for example we are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also given cache (or memory) size (number of page frames that the cache can hold at a given time).

To get a broader understanding of linked lists, here's an overview: A linked list is easiest explained as a linear data structure with the collection of multiple nodes, where each element stores its own data and a pointer to the location of the next element. The last link is essentially a linked list that points to null, which indicates it's at the end of a chain. An element, on the other hand, in a linked list is called a node.

In short, Quality Assurance checks if proper processes are being followed, while Quality Control deals with maintaining the quality of a software product. If the Amazon hiring manager you are meeting with has any responsibility for QA or QC in their department, they will likely ask you to differentiate the two. Things that they might want to hear are things like.....\n\nQuality Assurance - Assures that the approach and/or method used to produce a part are designed and implemented correctly. \n\nQuality Control - A process used to test, verify and identify a defect.

Please remember this since the Amazon technical manager that knows development and debugging well will quiz you on multiple facets of this area. It's really important to note that hiring managers will want to find out how good the quality of your code is. The reason is they will know how much time you will be spending on the debugging process.

There are several levels of interview questions that will come up to test your knowledge of basic to complex problem-solving solutions. This one sits somewhere in the middle of the pack. When an interviewer asks whether or not you need a loop or recursion, (depending on your skill level) she/he is asking the order in which elements are inserted in a set.

In cases where I need to delete an array using a more defined descriptive logic, the approach I take here is to find duplicate elements in a given array, then run an outer loop to 0 to size.

These are just random numbers for now. In a sorted array, you can compare whether a number is equal to the expected next number or not. Alternatively, you can also use the BitSet method in Java to solve this problem as well. A BitSet solution is more general, as you can use it to find more than one missing value on an integer array.

Looking at this problem from a high level, this can easily be solved by calculating the sum of the series using n(n+1)/2, to solve this problem. It's a quick and efficient way to do it, but keep in mind that it cannot be used if the array contains more than one number or if the array contains duplicates.

I also used two pointers to solve this, one to compare an element, and its closest neighbor to maintain a distinct element.

What an interviewer wants to know is whether you can explain how you arrive at an answer and the reasoning behind your findings. This is important because when you explain if a link contains a cycle, you need to back that up with a verbal or written (whiteboard) example. A common response might be the mention of let's say that a meeting point is 'P' steps away from the beginning of the cycle, and the 'cyclists' meet when cyclist 1 has taken a '7' total steps toward the point.", "\"The way that I find a starting node of a cycle is I measure the length of 'R' and how far the distance is away from the cycle.

Since there are several examples I can give to make my point, I would like to share one more. The next pointer of each node that is traversed is made to point to this temporary node. This way we are using the next pointer of a node as a flag to indicate whether the node has been traversed or not. If I come across a node that points to null, then the loop doesn't exist.

On one hand, the speed of sorting can depend on the environment, in which the sorting is done, and on the other hand, it can depend on the type of items that are sorted and the distribution of these particular items. For example, if you are sorting a large database that cannot fit into memory all at once, this would be quite different from sorting an array of 100 integers.

The next step is to look for random numbers between 0 and 10 times the array size so I can create array content. I may or may not do a high-repetition test with numbers between 0 and 1/100 times in the same context as well. After I do this, the results may come back as completely random, sorted, or reversed.

If the interview is going well, it wouldn't be a bad idea to talk about some of the strengths and weaknesses of a few that you have used. \nAs a reference, the top languages are likely Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C#, Ruby, PHP, Swift and SQL.", "\"Every software developer has a preferred language, and I'm no different. There are a few that I like and would put them on my preferred list. Let me start by giving you a few that I have found to be very useful in various environments. Perl is probably among the top for me for several reasons. Compared to Python, it's about three times as fast when reading PASTA files, and it only needs half the storage space to store sequences in memory. Java is another one of my preferred favorites, again for many reasons, not only is it good for programming algorithms but it can be used across multiple platforms including web applications. Lastly in this group, I need to include C# because it requires less memory for holding strings and less time to read these types of files than most other languages.\""]}, {"topic": "Software+Developer", "question": "What is software scope, and what does the process involve?", "answers": ["Software scope is a set of activities and actions that are to be performed as part of the delivery of a software product. Software scope should be well defined with phase by phase milestones, functionalities and deliverable components. A question like this will be asked during an interview with Amazon regardless of what experience level you are at in software development. This is a fundamental question that all software developers should know, and know well. Let me give you some clarifying pointers that you can use for a better explanation and response. Software scope identifies a few different but important elements including what the product will do, what is outside the scope of the project (what is not to be done), what is the timeline for completion of the project, who is documenting the list of deliverables, goals, tasks, and what the estimated cost of the project will be. There's one more part that should be covered because it comes up more times than not in a Amazon interview. Project Scope creep. This is when the project experiences changes or uncontrolled growth during the project. The reason for this is because the project was not well defined, documented or controlled early in the project specification phase.", "\"Software scope for me is relatively easy because at my current company, I'm involved at every stage of the documentation and project delivery process. It is my responsibility to identify all aspects of project scope, including but not limited to what the end product will do, what the expected timeline will be, who needs to approve deliverables at every phase, what the goals and tasks will be for assigned team members, how the features will work and their characteristics, and what the estimated cost will be for the final product.

This includes changes in the code, documentation, and process. Change control, however unpopular, is a function that ensures all changes made to the software system are consistent with Amazon development practices and internal methodologies. The ultimate goal is to see productivity improvement with a minimal amount of mistakes throughout the development lifecycle. Here, the interviewer is looking for how you prioritize configuration management duties and responsibilities, and your experience with controlling something even if you don't know what it is. This can be tricky, so let me explain. The reason configuration management is used is if there are multiple team members working on a software or revision which is running on multiple machines or needs constant updating. Another reason is if a company has multiple locations or divisions that need to distribute work concurrently.", "\"My definition of software configuration management is a set of activities that identify a number of items including source code modules, test cases, requirements specification documents, tools used, objects, files, and CSCI in SCM repositories just to name a few. There are also other important activities that I coincide with these actions as well. The first thing I look at is a baseline which lets me know the accepted version of a software configuration item. The second is change control, which is a method that ensures quality and consistency when changes are made. Third on this list is configuration audits which verify that the software meets the minimum baseline needs and that the deliverable is being met.\""]}, {"topic": "Software+Developer", "question": "Prior to starting any software development project here at Amazon, we perform a feasibility study. What is your opinion on a feasibility study, and when should it be done?", "answers": ["As a prospective Amazon Software Developer, you need to look at things from a broader perspective in order to gain a bigger picture of what your internal customer (department), or external customer (client) really wants. In the early stages of the software development cycle, you may find that a feasibility study might be required. There are two important factors to consider before determining whether or not a feasibility study is required. A feasibility study is really broken down into two important categories. The first is Technical in nature, and the second is an Operational view. The Amazon interviewer wants to know if you follow protocol by offering a feasibility study to the client or just go through the motions of your job. It's important to make mention of this in your interview because it helps crystallize in the interviewer's mind that you go above and beyond the norm to get the job done right. Again, the interviewer is asking for your opinion, so it's important to express your opinion with an explanation of why you think it should or shouldn't be performed.", "\"In my current role, I was asked by senior management whether or not a feasibility study would provide insight into potential productivity improvements and cost-saving measures within the organization. I took on the task of planning and executing a feasibility study to determine what type of outcome we could expect. I gathered a team and formed a committee, and assigned each team member a task, a goal, and a phased timeline to report back on their findings. After the feasibility study was completed, we analyzed the data and found that there was just cause to perform a full-scale feasibility study. The results provided insightful information about what areas of the company needed further analysis and other areas that started seeing improvements. We selected the technology, production, operations, and accounting for this study. After all the data was analyzed, I provided a draft of our findings to management for review for accuracy, relevance and completeness. I was given praise for this project since it did help the selected departments in every aspect of the operation.\""]}, {"topic": "Software+Developer", "question": "As part of software development, were you involved with working on functional and non-functional requirements?", "answers": ["In short, functional requirements are functional features that are expected by users from a proposed software product. Non-functional requirements on the other hand are more related to security, performance, and the look and feel of the user interface, a.k.a. (UI). In order for a project to be successful, it is critically essential that both the customer and the Amazon project delivery teams have a clear definition and agreement on what the project scope and detailed requirements are going to be.\n\nThere are three types of requirements: conscious, unconscious and unidentified or TBD requirements.  \nWhen the Amazon hiring manager asks this question, they want to know if part of your job requires gathering and analyzing functional or non-functional requirements. For functional requirements gathering, they will want to hear things like how the system behaves under certain conditions within its environment, how it responds to inputs and what outputs it generates. As far as non-functional requirements, they will want to also hear things like constraints on the system, quality attributes, security, performance and availability, for example.", "\"Yes, I work with cross-functional teams within our organization on functional and non-functional requirements. I take a unique approach to how I address these types of requirements. It's kind of a step-by-step method really. There are three requirement types that I use. Conscious, unconscious, and unknown requirements. Conscious is when stakeholders have a high-level awareness of the basic requirements. Unconscious is what stakeholders would like to see, but didn't translate the message clearly enough to see the desired result. This stakeholder assumes that the work they envisioned will be delivered, which in most cases falls short of their expectation. Unknown is the type that has yet to be imagined or realized. Stakeholders typically don't give input into this type because they assume it is not achievable or cannot be delivered as expected.\""]}, {"topic": "Software+Developer", "question": "Talk about the differences between structured English and Pseudo Code?", "answers": ["Let's begin with what structured English and Pseudo Code are. Structured English is native English language. Its primary purpose is to write the structure of a program module. It uses programming language keywords to achieve this. Pseudo Code on the other hand is like a programming language without syntax of any specific language. This question can come in different forms, and each Amazon hiring manager will ask it differently, but essentially they are asking the same question. Pseudocode is a kind of structured English used for describing algorithms. It describes the entire logic of an algorithm so that when implementation happens, it is translated line by line into source code. Basically, this is an algorithm question that the Amazon hiring manager asks to see if you're old school, and if you've written code in Lisp, FORTRAN or C programming language. This tells the manager how you approach a project, whether it's task structured or methodology driven. Either is not a wrong answer, but you want to ask the interviewer early in the interviewer what type of development organization he/she runs so you can answer accordingly.", "\"My approach is simple, I take an organized approach to how I write code, and the way I differentiate structured English, and Pseudo Code. First, I make a list of the main tasks that need to be accomplished. Then, I break them down into small manageable tasks that can be explained with a short phrase. It's been my experience that the further I dig into the correlation between pseudo code and real code, I find that pseudo code helps me plan the structure, but doesn't help me resolve the real-world programming. In my opinion, that's really the bottom line difference in simple terms between the two. Since either is actual programming languages, they act as structured algorithms that can be used in a programming language.\""]}, {"topic": "Virtual+Customer+Service+Associate", "question": "Virtual Customer Service Associates must have the ability to empathize with customers and prioritize their needs.

Keep in mind that Amazon ranks the satisfaction of its customers first, so this may impact your prioritization method when hired. \n\nSome of the most common frameworks for task prioritization include: \n\n- The MoSCoW method, which is an acronym for Must have (vital), Should have (priority), Could have (optional), and Won't have (scratch it!).\n\n- The RICE scoring model, which is an acronym for Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort.\n\n- The Kano model, which focuses on product features and how important they may or may not be (Delighters, \nPerformance Features, and Basic Features).", "\"Typically, when I am prioritizing tasks or product features, I will use the MoSCoW model. I have been trained in Agile methodology and lean toward this model because it focuses on both the project stakeholders' goals and the customer's needs. I also find it the easiest method to use when I need to explain my decision-making process to individuals outside of the technical aspects of the project. The first step is to ask if the product feature is a 'must-have,' vital feature. Then, I ask if it is a 'should-have,' which makes the feature a priority. Moving down the list, is I ask if the product feature is a 'could-have.' Perhaps it's optional or could be visited at a later time. Then, I can determine if the feature is a 'won't-have,' meaning it's time to scratch that particular idea. Then, my team will prioritize the must-have and should-have features.

In my current Product Manager position, Company XYZ approaches gathering customer feedback in a variety of ways. We often utilize focus groups; however, we don't lean on these focus groups as our only source when making decisions about a product. We also have a well-established support community made up of customers who are avid users. We ask for customer feedback early in the development process, and then we invite this support community to test new products throughout the different stages of development.  It's important to take customer feedback with emotional intelligence. Rather than becoming defensive, my team and I listen and absorb the information. As the Product Manager, I practice self-awareness to avoid pushing my personal preferences onto the product. When we take on a new project, the team performs robust user testing. We also conduct customer interviews and perform market assessments.

Ego is not an obstacle for me in the workplace as I rarely benefit from being the smartest person in the room. Instead, hiring people that I feel are smarter than me is a wonderful way to expand my team's capabilities. Earlier in my PM career, I read a quote from Ewing Marion Kauffman who said, 'Hire people who are smarter than you. In doing so, you prevent limiting the organization to the level of your own ability, and you grow the capabilities of your company.'

Aside from direct sales, Amazon offers numerous subscription services such as Amazon Prime, streaming media options, and app-based purchase options. Also, third-party selling is a fantastic way for Amazon to offer the widest range of products globally while carrying less slow-moving inventory than its competitors. What is most exciting for me is Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I am applying to work as a Product Manager. The concept of AWS offering reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services to companies is incredibly innovative and a service that no company can beat.

By sending out a simple customer email survey and asking, 'How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?' and offering a 1-10 option, we quickly collect valuable customer satisfaction information. After answering, we segment our customers into 3 categories: Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. Detractors will rate the product a 1-6 out of 10. We then know that these customers dislike part of the product or have an overall issue with it. Passives will rate the product a 7 or 8 out of 10. This segment is more likely to use the product but will not be loyal to it. Those who rate the product a 9 or 10 out of 10 are the Promoters. These customers are more likely to recommend our product. Using Net Promoter Scores, we can quickly assess whether the product is being embraced. I like this method as it's more of an average and helps the team focus on who to survey further based on an extreme dislike and an enthusiastic love of the product.\""]}, {"topic": "Product+Manager", "question": "How do you break down a complex problem into manageable pieces?", "answers": ["Breaking down problems into smaller parts is an essential skill as a Product Manager.

For instance, just last month, our team encountered a significant roadblock that could have caused a major issue with our client. Instead of showing discouragement, I held an open and honest meeting with the team, where we made a plan for tackling the issue head-on. We did not let the situation intimidate us and got back on track quickly. When it comes to earning trust, I am an ally to everyone.

For this answer, let's assume that there is quite a bit of uncertainty around the product and what customers really want to see. In that case, I would begin with quantitative analysis since the hard data will likely answer more questions for me from the start. I would build a survey to send out to our customers and perhaps perform some A/B testing. The answers we receive will show us what our customers are most excited about and what they are least engaged in. Next, I want to understand why the customer is leaning one way or the other. This is where I would begin the qualitative analysis. In my current PM role, we often take a select number of survey respondents and have a 15-minute call with them to uncover further why they chose the preferences they did.

I managed the accessories department, including fine jewelry, sunglasses, handbags, and small leather goods. Most of the accessories were by well-known labels such as Chloe, Marni, and Moschino, which rarely go on sale. (Task) Just before spring, I was instructed by the corporate office to open up a clearance section where a small selection from these luxury brands would go on sale. (Action) After the announcement of this spring sale, I heard some chatter about the department store's employees purchasing the best stock before becoming available to the customers. I knew that our head office put significant marketing dollars behind advertising the spring sale, and I felt that it would be a disservice to our customers if they arrived on the sale's opening day to find the product picked through. I contacted the Regional Manager and asked if the corporate office would consider making a policy against employees purchasing these clearance items until after the spring sale was closed to the public. (Result) The corporate office agreed, and the policy was announced to the employees, many of who were greatly disappointed. As an intuitive leader, I foresaw many potential conflicts, including customer complaints and arguments amongst the store employees, if we did not make a policy change. I had already seen the employees distracted by what they wanted to purchase at a deep discount, resulting in a lack of focus at work. Because I was keenly aware of the situation, I chose to take action and suggest an unpopular policy change. However, as the Store Manager, I needed to show loyalty to the company and ensure our customers were cared for. In this instance, I embodied Amazon's Leadership Principle of 'Invent and Simplify.' I showed backbone by committing to my stance, regardless of how unpopular the decision was amongst my team members. It did not take long for the team to understand the reasoning behind my actions, and we were able to get through the spring sale without conflict.\""]}, {"topic": "Brand+Specialist", "question": "Amazon believes that leaders are never done learning.

But, one day, I reflected on my previous year and concluded that I did a lot of learning and planning but did not take a lot of action. I found myself in a cycle of learning but not often applying the lessons. I often felt hesitation to move forward on the learning I was absorbing. I decided to start taking action on one thing every week. For instance, one week, I stopped researching how to write the perfect resume and hired a resume writer. The next week, I stopped combing endlessly through job boards and instead picked up the phone and reached out to 5 people to ask them for job leads. This action quickly compounded, and it's how I found myself interviewing with Amazon! I took action towards the goals that I wanted to achieve, rather than only planning my strategy and stopping short of taking action. As a Brand Specialist and an Amazonian, I must be ready to 'Learn and Be Curious' and take action.

So, I was diligently taking notes because I wanted to absorb the way the manager handled this discrepancy. To my surprise, the Senior Sales Manager asked for my input on the situation! It was an honor to have my opinion considered. I needed to deliver thoughts based on what I knew about the company and best practices in employee training. (Action) I spoke up and suggested that the core issue might be that the sales team was not clear on the unique benefit for each client.

When I first started, I was given a portfolio containing a handful of existing clients and warm leads. I was instructed to grow the portfolio by nurturing existing accounts and developing new business through the provided leads. When I first inspected my portfolio, I realized that over 70% of the quarterly sales came from one client. However, this client put their account on a temporary hold due to internal restructuring. This event caused a major struggle for me since I was instructed to hit my sales targets, yet I had very few active client dollars. I was in real danger of not hitting my first months' sales goal, and therefore I would have easily fallen short on my quarterly quota. (Action) I worked extra long hours and divided these hours by new business development activities. I called dormant accounts and kept my biggest client 'warm' despite their hold on their account.

Recently, I was handed the file of a client known to have unrealistic expectations. My colleagues did not enjoy working with this client. (Task) Since I was the only coordinator yet to work with her, my manager wanted to see if I could develop a positive working relationship with this client. (Action) I set up a face-to-face meeting with my new client right away. Rather than start the meeting with a discussion of action steps and ideas, I addressed expectations. The client laid out everything that she expected in fine detail. Rather than interrupt her or tell her that these expectations couldn't be met, I asked where her benchmarks came from. The client expressed that she had researched a competitor's strategy for a similar project felt that our team could generate similar results. I thanked the client for her transparency and asked her to give the team and me a few days to research and come back with a project scope. We spent the next couple of days analyzing a few marketing case studies released by my client's competitor. We quickly realized that this competitor's marketing and advertising budget was far larger than the resources available to my client. In our next meeting, I explained the quantitative and qualitative data we collected. I expressed that we could use some of her competitor's approaches; however, the results would not be the same because financial resources were more limited in her case. Then, I presented a more appropriate strategy and project timeline with clear milestones. (Result) The client thanked me for offering a well-researched and realistic project outline versus simply telling her that her vision couldn't be met. In the past, she felt that she was being spoken down to, and she appreciated that I paid attention to her needs, took the time to understand her market, and research what her competitors were doing. In this instance, I showed customer obsession by working vigorously to gain and keep the clients' trust.

Last week, an upset customer emailed our corporate office to complain that one of my staff members was rude to them. The District Manager called me to discuss the situation. While the District Manager described the chain of events as outlined in this disgruntled customers' email, I instinctually began to feel that the customers' account of the situation was inflated. I knew the character of the Associate this customer was talking about and wholeheartedly believed that she was not a rude-natured person. (Action) After hearing the District Manager out, I said that I would meet with the Associate to ask more questions before approaching any disciplinary action. Later that day, I had a meeting with the Associate and asked for her account of the situation. The Associate explained that the customers' purchase, a pair of shoes, had obviously been worn. Their purchase also fell past our store's 30-day return policy. The Associate politely declined to refund the customer's purchase and explained the return policy. The customer responded by verbally degrading the Associate, leaving the store in a fury, and then emailed our corporate office to complain. After meeting with the Associate, I called the District Manager to explain the other side of the story. The District Manager asked me to write the Associate up and instruct them to write an apology email to the customer. I felt it was in bad taste to apologize to the customer, considering they verbally attacked the Associate. My stance was that we should protect our employees first and not allow customers to behave this way towards our valued team members. I expressed that this decision would negatively impact our relationship with the employee. Still, the District Manager did not agree, and I was to instruct the Associate to apologize.

Frugality is one reason why I could study full time, work part-time, and graduate with minimal student loan debt! Before attending school, I met with my friends' parent, who is a financial planner. She helped me arrange a realistic budget for my time in school. We worked out what I could afford after my wages came in and my bills went out. This plan helped me understand what it meant to live within my means and spend only what had been budgeted. I track my budget in an app called Mint, and it helps me reach my financial goals while also saving money by tracking my spending, including subscription monitoring. Most people my age, leaving home for the first time and getting their first significant sense of independence, would not approach their finances this way. I fully believe that frugality is not about being 'cheap' but about understanding and respecting the value of money.

The professor asked us to pair up with one other student to complete this final assignment. The fellow student I collaborated with was one that I had not yet had the opportunity to work alongside, so I was excited for the chance to make a new connection. Early into the assignment, I noticed that she was really good at the research portion of the assignment but seemed to fall short on tasks that required more communication, such as exploring and building a brand strategy. (Action) Rather than bring my thoughts to her immediately, I decided first to observe her notable strengths. Feedback or criticism can be hard to deliver, especially when it's a peer, so I wanted to make sure that my observations of her work were timely and constructive. A week into our project, we met to review our outline and begin building the presentation in more detail. In this meeting, I took the opportunity to start the conversation with her regarding strengthening her communication and strategy input. First, I told her that I was very impressed with her research skills and explained that I was excited to learn stronger research methods. I then mentioned that communication was also a significant factor in being a successful business marketing professional. I noted a couple of areas where I felt her work fell short of our professor's expectations. I offered to show her what I would have done instead. I took the time to explain my reasoning and supported my feedback with examples from other case studies we had visited during class. She expressed that she had been aware of her shortcomings and was thankful for the honest feedback. Together, we worked on boosting her abilities in strategy and communication. We also worked on improving my research abilities. (Result) The rest of the project went smoothly. We each gained new and improved skills and developed a mutual respect. In the end, we received a top grade and were both proud of our success.

We also have a well-established support community made up of customers who are avid users. We ask for customer feedback early in the development process, and then we invite this support community to test new products throughout the different stages of development.

This data will help me better understand the company's ability to generate profit from the product we are focusing on. Overall, I consider my financial analysis and P&L knowledge to be intermediate.  I plan to learn more and grow my knowledge base by continually educating myself on financial analysis.

I utilize a pre-launch and post-launch checklist that I have developed and tweaked over my Product Manager career.

We must know how the product will be best positioned before ever jumping into a launch. Setting a launch date and communicating this date with my team and the project stakeholders is also critical. When everyone is on the same page with the launch target, we can better ensure that this timeline is met. Also, gaining momentum for the product requires figuring out which social media channels and other media the marketing team will use to build hype for the product release. Last, and perhaps the most important, is to test the new product and its functions rigorously. A launch will only be as successful as the product is simple to use, after all.

One of my favorite ways to measure customer satisfaction is through NPS scores. By sending out a simple customer email survey and asking, 'How likely are you to recommend this product to a friend?' and offering a 1-10 option, we quickly collect valuable customer satisfaction information. After answering, we segment our customers into 3 categories: Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. Detractors will rate the product a 1-6 out of 10. We then know that these customers dislike part of the product or have an overall issue with it. Passives will rate the product a 7 or 8 out of 10. This segment is more likely to use the product but will not be loyal to it. Those who rate the product a 9 or 10 out of 10 are the Promoters. These customers are more likely to recommend our product.

The first step is to ask if the product feature is a 'must-have,' vital feature. Then, I ask if it is a 'should-have,' which makes the feature a priority. Moving down the list, is I ask if the product feature is a 'could-have.' Perhaps it's optional or could be visited at a later time. Then, I can determine if the feature is a 'won't-have,' meaning it's time to scratch that particular idea. Then, my team will prioritize the must-have and should-have features.

When it comes to the interview process, a company can have a diverse panel of interviewers versus leaving the hiring decisions to one person or a group of similar individuals.

They also go on to say, 'In a world that's changing quickly, you're guaranteed to fail if you don't take any risks.'\n\nAnother core value is 'Move Fast.' Facebook explains 'We believe that it's better to move fast and make mistakes than to move slowly and miss opportunities. Doing so enables us to build more things and learn faster.'  \n\nEach time you shortlist and present a candidate to stakeholders and decision-makers, you are taking a risk that they will say 'no' to your candidate.

When leaders can look at the full picture, they are much more likely to take an open-minded approach. This approach often clears up disagreements on candidate quality. Sometimes a disagreement on the quality of a candidate means that I go back to my search and find a couple of new candidates for consideration. Other times this situation means that we collectively compromise by interviewing the candidate one more time in an attempt to uncover the core reason the leader feels hesitant to make a job offer. I believe that it's in the company's best interest that all stakeholders agree on a candidate before a job offer is made.

There are a couple of ways to answer it so I will give you both examples. The two most common methods of searching a graph or a tree related to a depth-first search are depth-first search and breadth-first search for starters. Depending on the application you are using and the result you want to achieve, this should be determined by the type of data that is contained in your tree or graph data structure. For a Breath First Search, I start at the root node. I then search all their children nodes moving from left to right, then I repeat the process at the level below the root node. I typically repeat this again on each level until I reach the end of the tree or node. As a general practice, I use a queue as an intermediary step as a way of keeping track of what nodes I need to search.\""]}, {"topic": "Software+Developer", "question": "Talk about the differences between structured English and Pseudo Code.", "answers": ["Let's begin with what structured English and Pseudo Code are. Structured English is native English language. Its primary purpose is to write the structure of a program module. It uses programming language keywords to achieve this. Pseudo Code, on the other hand, is like a programming language without syntax of any specific language. This question can come in different forms, and each Google hiring manager will ask it differently, but essentially they are asking the same question. Pseudocode is a kind of structured English used for describing algorithms. It describes the entire logic of an algorithm so that when implementation happens, it is translated line by line into source code. Basically, this is an algorithm question that the Google hiring manager asks to see if you're old school, and if you've written code in Lisp, FORTRAN, or C programming language. This tells the manager how you approach a project, whether it's task structured or methodology driven. Either is not a wrong answer, but you want to ask the interviewer early in the interviewer what type of development organization he/she runs so you can answer accordingly.", "\"My approach is simple: I take an organized approach to how I write code, and the way I differentiate structured English and Pseudo Code. First, I make a list of the main tasks that need to be accomplished. Then, I break them down into small manageable tasks that can be explained with a short phrase. It's been my experience that the further I dig into the correlation between pseudo code and real code, I find that pseudo code helps me plan the structure, but doesn't help me resolve the real-world programming. In my opinion, that's really the bottom line difference in simple terms between the two.

It always helps to start by stating that you have used several languages and have a high confidence level with all of them, but if you had to pick, give them a range and narrow them to one of your favorites. Don't be surprised if an interviewer asks why you like that language and what benefit it gives you.

Compared to Python, is about three times as fast when reading PASTA files, and it only needs half the storage space to store sequences in memory. Java is another one of my preferred favorites, again for many reasons; not only is it good for programming algorithms, but it can be used across multiple platforms including web applications.

More than likely, they are looking for someone who is an analytical thinker and can solve problems relatively easily. Let me demonstrate. Let's say I have an array number from 1 to 100. These are just random numbers for now. In a sorted array, you can compare whether a number is equal to the expected next number or not. Alternatively, you can also use the BitSet method in Java to solve this problem as well. A BitSet solution is more general, as you can use it to find more than one missing value on an integer array.

Looking at this problem from a high level, this can easily be solved by calculating the sum of the series using n(n+1)/2, to solve this problem. It's a quick and efficient way to do it, but keep in mind that it cannot be used if the array contains more than one number, or if the array contains duplicates.

What an interviewer wants to know is whether you can explain how you arrive at an answer and the reasoning behind your findings. This is important because when you explain if a link contains a cycle, you need to back that up with a verbal or written (whiteboard) example.

Since there are several examples I can give to make my point, I would like to share one more. The next pointer of each node that is traversed is made to point to this temporary node. This way, we are using the next pointer of a node as a flag to indicate whether the node has been traversed or not. If I come across a node that points to null, then the loop doesn't exist.

To get a broader understanding of linked lists, here's an overview: A linked list is easiest explained as a linear data structure with the collection of multiple nodes, where each element stores its own data and a pointer to the location of the next element. The last link is essentially a linked list that points to null, which indicates it's at the end of a chain. An element on the other hand in a linked list is called a node.

The Google hiring manager might start with a question about what your favorite language is and then move to your approach and possibly your methodology or reasoning for favoring that language. Let me give an example of how this question might be answered. If we intend to use Java for this example, we would look at the LRU cache and recently used entries, then remove the element from the bottom and add an element to the start of a LinkedList.

Java seems to be a tool of choice in most development environments, and for me as well. Say for example we are given total possible page numbers that can be referred. We are also given cache (or memory) size (number of page frames that the cache can hold at a given time).

When a hiring manager asks about comparing inputs and output to the middle element of an array, they are asking if a search returns the position of an element. It's important to know and understand this concept. Another question that may be asked is whether or not an input is less than or greater than an element.

On one hand, the speed of sorting can depend on the environment in which the sorting is done, and on the other hand, it can depend on the type of items that are sorted and the distribution of these particular items. For example, if you are sorting a large database that cannot fit into memory all at once, this would be quite different from sorting an array of 100 integers. Adding to that, not only will the implementation of an algorithm be quite different, but it may even be that the same algorithm.

The next step is to look for random numbers between 0 and 10 times the array size so I can create array content. I may or may not do a high-repetition test with numbers between 0 and 1/100 times in the same context as well. After I do this, the results may come back as completely random, sorted, or reversed.
