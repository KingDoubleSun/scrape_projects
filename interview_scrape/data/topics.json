In roles where optimum performance is directly attached to your compensation, quarterly reports are more common. \n\nYou will also want to ask about the quality of the reviews.

You can then begin to speak about how you have been reliable in the past or with your most recent employer. Perhaps you stayed late when necessary, checked your emails after hours when you knew a client would be responding, or maybe you would bring coffee for the team when they were working late on a project. \n\nIf the quality that the interviewer mentions are something you are not overly versed in, you can speak about how you are strengthening that area. For instance, if the essential quality is to be amazing in Excel, you could let the interviewer know that you are an intermediate user and you are taking coursework this month to reach expert-level status by the end of the year. \n\nWhatever the interviewers' response, be ready to express how you will bring this vital quality to the company if you are the successful candidate."]}, {"topic": "Ask+the+Interviewer", "question": "What is your ideal timeline for this hiring decision?", "answers": ["When you are interviewing between multiple companies, it can be tricky to get the timing right with interviews, offers, and job acceptance.

You will see the company's urgency. A company that wants to fill the role quickly will be on the ball. They will probably have times already blocked off for the next interview phase. Preparedness is a great sign, and it shows that the company is efficient. However, you want to make sure they aren't skipping steps in the interview process to get a warm body in the seat. If they are moving quickly while still vetting you correctly, this is a good sign. If they are not vetting you accurately, then beware, they may not be investing in you as an employee and, rather, deciding in a state of panic. \n\n2. You will see how interested the company is in you. If they genuinely think you could be a great fit, the interviewer will ask you what your timeline is in return. They will want to know how much time they have before another company makes an offer and scoops you up! \n\n3. You will see how well-organized the company is (or is not!). If the interviewer doesn't know the hiring timeline or cannot tell you what the next steps are in their interview process, this is a potential red flag. \n\n4.

These comprehensive assessments, such as Gallup, will show your employer how you are motivated, the learning methods you best respond to, and your preferred leadership styles. \n\n- Expert Management. When junior, inexperienced people are placed in leadership positions without training, nobody wins. The interviewer should assure you that those you are reporting to are experts in their realm.\n\n- Individual Development Plans. These plans are roadmaps for employees, created in collaboration with their leaders. The strategies focus on timed, measurable goals. Most IDPs are visited quarterly, like a performance review. \n\n- Clear Metrics. If you have clear targets and expectations, you are more likely to succeed in your role. If an employer lets you roam, hoping or guessing that your performance is satisfactory, you are more likely to become disengaged and quit. \n\n- Constructive Feedback. Managers who give on-point and actionable feedback are incredibly valuable. Your responsibility is to make sure you can accept all feedback graciously while implementing necessary change. \n\n- Organizational Structure.

Each graduate intern was assigned to a pharmacy manager to be trained and after learning and mastering each task, the pharmacy manager should check off the task on the list before moving forward to the next step, to ensure every part was being learned. And at the very end of the two weeks, the training pharmacy manager and the new trainee pharmacist had to sign to confirm that all parts were completed.  I was assigned to be trained by a pharmacy manager (let's call her Jessica). Upon starting, I found Jessica to be very intimidating and she didn\u2019t make me feel welcomed to her team as much as I was hoping. Also, there was no conversation between me and Jessica in regards to the check list that needed to be followed and completed by the end of these two weeks. I spent the first couple days helping around the pharmacy without learning anything new. When I brought up the checklist to Jessica, she seemed disengaged about following it and she was expecting me to just try to learn things as they came up during the day, as she was too busy to go through the checklist and ensure that I learn everything listed. \r\nAt this point, I knew that it would be up to me to lead my training and ensure success, and I wanted to remain dedicated, despite her lack of enthusiasm about the process. When I went home, I went through the training manuals independently and realized that there is a lot for me to learn, and it is impossible for me to do it on my own.  I wanted to confront her about how I would be more comfortable if we followed the checklist, as advised. but I was too intimated by her to share my thoughts. Giving the subject a lot of thought, I didn\u2019t want to take the situation personally and I kept in mind that she was human, just like the rest of us, and to ensure I got the training that I needed, I would have to talk to her. \r\nThe next day I asked if I could speak to her privately when she got a chance and she agreed. I explained how important it is to me to become the best pharmacist that I can be, and I was taking this training very seriously, as having successful first few days as a pharmacist on my own depends on it. I explained that I went through the training manuals independently and realized that there was a lot that I didn't know and would like to learn from an expert like her. She respectfully listened to me and assured me that she will do her best to address all tasks on the checklist that I needed to learn. Moreover, she explained that this process is very new to her, and she really didn\u2019t see the point in it, that was why she was not as enthusiastic about it.\r\n The next day at the beginning of the shift, she asked me to bring the checklist to go over some tasks, before it got busy in the pharmacy. The following days, we continued to do the same thing and we were successful at completing all the tasks on the checklist, and I got to learn things from her beyond the checklist that I appreciate to this day as a pharmacist.\"", "Good!

From my understanding, equity is our approach to reaching the end goal of equality. Equity means providing equal opportunity and equal access to everyone, no matter their situation. If I were to discover an equity problem in the workplace, I would start by researching which groups felt impacted and what was causing the impact. Then, I would request that my employer create measurable initiatives and a time-based action plan with specific change-focused targets and goals. For instance, in my current position, I heard from an employee that their family did not receive equal treatment regarding company health insurance benefits. I came to find that our spousal health insurance benefits did not mention same-sex partners. I immediately contacted our HR department, who put the wheels in motion to change the language attached to our benefits plan.

However, a company's hierarchy should not interfere with its ability to meet client needs. I have always respected the chain of command, whether that be at work or school.

I came to find that our spousal health insurance benefits did not mention same-sex partners.

For instance, my brother who works the night shift at the hospital is often busy and tired leading him to make bad food choices. Based on the patient's circumstance, I would first treat their existing disease with medications and suggest gradual behavioral changes.

Be sure to approach the pros and cons of each.", "\"There are many significant differences between the American and Canadian healthcare system, a topic I have studied extensively after living temporarily in Canada. The biggest difference is that Canadian healthcare is primarily publicly funded, where in the US, healthcare is heavily private. In Canada, there is equal access to healthcare regardless of job, income, or financial position. Overall, people in Canada may be healthier than in the U.S., but outcomes for those with severe disease are not as positive. Canadians face very long wait lists for services such as surgery, where in the US surgeons call quickly and perform many more operations in a year. With all of this said, it is essential to remember that a country's approach to healthcare is reflective of its views of society and government responsibility. Canada as a whole is has a more socialist viewpoint than the US, meaning that the Canadian approach in America would likely not be as impactful.\""]}, {"topic": "Multiple+Mini", "question": "How do you feel about stem cell research using fetal tissue?", "answers": ["Ethical based questions require you to look at an issue in a multi-faceted way.

I fully understand that stem cells are the body's raw materials, and these cells can help us to understand how diseases work. This practice is truly valuable to medical research. We can use these healthy cells to replace diseased cells and even test drugs to see if they are safe and effective. Embryonic stem cells, in particular, are obtained from early-stage embryos. These stem cells come from embryos fertilized outside of the womb, and not from a pregnant woman. These embryos are harvested specifically for research. In the process, these early-stage embryos are destroyed, which is where the controversy comes to play. Many people against this practice approach the situation with the same arguments around abortion because the practice prevents an embryo from becoming a baby. In my professional understanding, I do not consider an embryo to be human life yet, but rather a bundle of cells.

This project ran from 1990 to 2003, giving humans the ability to read the complete genetic blueprint of a human. This international effort sequenced 3 billion DNA letters in the human genome and is considered to be one of the most ambitious scientific undertakings of all time. Thanks to the Human Genome Project, we now have coverage of about 99 percent of the human genome's gene-containing regions, with an unprecedented accuracy of 99.99 percent. Of course, scientific undertakings as large as this do not come without controversy. One of the most positive outcomes of the Human Genome Project is that healthcare professionals, policymakers, students, and the public now know so much more when it comes to genetics and complex genetics-based disease. On the flip side, the project also raised ethical issues surrounding the design and conduct of genetic research, including privacy and consent.

Hippocrates, the 'Father of Medicine,' held strong beliefs that disease was natural, and not due to superstition or punishment from the gods. This belief led him to understand that many cures were naturally available to us on this earth. Today, many of Hippocrates' theories are now far removed from modern medicine. Yet, the saying, 'Let food be thy medicine and medicine be they food,' I believe refers to what we still find today, which is that we can often heal ourselves naturally. In many circumstances, we can use the foods, herbs, and natural resources from the planet to heal our bodies. Hippocrates supported a 'lifestyle medicine' approach, and he was also known for saying, 'Walking is man's best medicine.'

Be prepared to defend your stance.", "\"They say that those who can't do - teach. I disagree with this sentiment. I wholeheartedly believe that as a physician, I need to be my healthiest, perform research, and be the benchmark when it comes to personal health. One example is if a patient comes to a general practitioner because they want tools, resources, and support to quit smoking. How would the patient feel if, during that visit, the GP smelled like cigarette smoke? Another reason that I feel a responsibility to be a healthy role model is that the healthier I am, the longer I will be able to practice medicine and help others.

Pharmaceutical lobbying is when pharmaceutical drug companies work to have the medical industry, medical professionals, or politicians act in favor of the pharmaceutical industry and its products. According to CNN Health, one well-known pharma lobbying group spent around $27.5 million on lobbying activities in one year alone. Be prepared to speak about lobbying and the impact it has on the medical industry.", "\"I have come to learn that lobbying impacts many industries and sectors, including medicine, education, law, and politics. When it comes to the medical industry, lobbying can hurt physicians and patients, in a few ways. We see reports that the big pharma lobbying group known as PhRMA has spent as much as $300 million to defend higher prescription drug costs. As we know, unaffordable medication is a significant issue for many ill people in our country. One example of this impact is the outrage over Mylan's EpiPen prices in 2016. When Mylan purchased the rights to EpiPen in 2007, they gradually raised the list price from about $50 per auto-injector to over $600 for a two-pack. The move boosted EpiPen profits to $1.1 billion a year. Much of this was due to greedy pharma lobbying efforts directed at drug pricing and the limiting of generic competitors. After Trumps' speech in 2018 regarding the pending fall of pharmaceutical influence on drug prices, we have seen an uptick of big pharma pouring money into lobbying campaigns when it comes to laws surrounding prescription drug prices. Today, despite this surge in lobbying, we continue to see improvements on drug prices, and I look forward to tracking this topic of money, drugs, and government as my medical career further unfolds.\""]}, {"topic": "Multiple+Mini", "question": "An underage patient asks you for a birth control prescription but asks that you not tell her parents.

Is it for regulating her cycle, or for family planning purposes? I would ask questions to ensure she is in a place of consent if the reasoning were due to sexual activity. Any patient is within her rights to ask for confidentiality; however, I would inquire as to why she does not want her parents to know. This inquiry will help me to understand if she needs referrals to additional resources for family planning and sexual health.

Mainly, I would not be judgemental and would be sure to come from a respectful point of view. I would want my mother to receive honest advice, whether that advice comes from another Ph.D. or me.

I am aware that in January 2019, the state of New York enacted changes to the Reproductive Health Act, which included further access to abortion and the legalities surrounding the performance of late-term abortions. The law also removed abortion from the state's criminal code, removing criminal liability for doctors and other healthcare professionals. My stance on abortion is not black and white, as every person, case, and circumstance is different. Looking at countries where abortion is illegal, we see around 30,000 deaths of women due to botched procedures.  I am happy to see more attention going to the laws surrounding a woman's right to choose, and I hope to see a point in time when all women, no matter where they live, will feel free to do with their bodies as they see fit, under proper medical care and expertise.\""]}, {"topic": "Multiple+Mini", "question": "Many pediatric associations recommended that male circumcisions no longer be routinely performed.

Talk to the panel about the arguments against routine male circumcision, and what you understand members of the medical community to be saying. Next, discuss your thoughts and ideas from a medical point of view.", "\"Religious and social norms aside, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that male circumcision can reduce the risk of contracting HIV from an infected partner by up to 60%. Medical studies also show that male circumcision can reduce the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and penile cancer. There are other benefits such as the reduced risk of urinary tract infections, for starters. With that said, many in the medical profession believe this to be at a higher cost. There is a belief that we perform this procedure without much medical reasoning and more for appearance or societal norms. When doctors perform male circumcision within the first week after birth, there is generally little consequence to the infant; however, this outcome can change when male circumcisions are performed later in life. My stance on male circumcision is that every family should be well informed of the potential benefits, possible risks, and be very clear on why they are deciding on circumcision for the infant in the first place.

People who are not provided coverage through an employer, students, new immigrants - many people cannot afford the hundreds of dollars per month that it can cost to purchase individual health insurance. This issue leaves many people who are in a healthcare crisis feeling lost and desperate. If I could make changes to repair this issue, I would begin by looking at other government structures where access to healthcare is much better. For instance, in the Netherlands, most people have easy access to primary care centers. Health insurance is mandatory; however, it is much more affordable and accessible than the choices we have here in the USA. All in all, if I could make a change, I would entertain an offering similar to that in the Netherlands or even Switzerland, which includes universal coverage through mandatory yet affordable private insurance.\"", "\"I think if I could change one thing about the healthcare system, I would try to contribute to a change from a treatment system to a prevention-based system in regards to the United States healthcare. Healthcare spending is increasing in the US at an unsustainable rate, outpacing GDP growth. One of the reasons is the rise in chronic health conditions, which can be costly to treat. I would try to increase access to healthcare so that patients can address their health issues sooner from a more prevention standpoint rather than later from a treatment standpoint. While working in my parents' post office, I saw many Vietnamese immigrants that spoke little or no English. Although I am not fluent in Vietnamese, the amount I knew helped ease their confusion about shipping. There is a large Vietnamese immigrant community where I live, and the doctors are filled with Vietnamese patients. I want to increase my community's access to healthcare, improving the Vietnamese along the way to better communicate with Vietnamese patients. Language barriers can be a significant barrier to healthcare, and I want to alleviate that problem.\"", "Prevention is a crucial factor to consider. Your response shows a lot of thought and a firm understanding of treatment approaches vs. prevention approaches. I felt a bit lost when you started to discuss your experiences at the post office. I recommend reworking the last half of your response by making a more immediate connection between language barriers and a prevention-based system.", "\"While many issues are present, I believe it is necessary to shift to a system that reimburses based on outcome rather than based on the fact that a procedure was formed. While I do knw the prevalence of the issue, I do understand that sometimes people are designated for procedures or medications that are medically unnecessary. In such instances where the procedures are unnecessary, there is the risk of both physical and financial harm to patients. Regarding financial harm, the price of insurance for other patients may increase due to higher than necessary expenditures by insurance companies. Regarding prescriptions, sometimes medications that are significantly more expensive may be prescribed without having palpably higher efficacy than cheaper meds.\r\n\r\nBy switching to results-oriented reimbursement, we can deter the prescription of unnecessary procedures and medications. We will also incentivize medical decision making that puts the patient's wellness first. The primary downside for results-oriented reimbursement is that sometimes a procedure or medical decision is contested amongst professionals, and therefore determining whether the result was optimal relative to other procedures or patients can become subjective. Additionally, sometimes difficult decisions need to be made with urgency and may not allow for ideal preparations and option weighing, though the patient would still benefit from such procedures relative to no medical treatment in those instances. Additionally, hospitals could become strained if they are to receive fewer finances for procedures performed. However, the benefit of placing a priority on patient wellness makes this the one thing I would change in healthcare, and with proper legislation, this could be implemented effectively to improve patient outcomes and reduce the financial strain on patients.\"", "You seem to have a lot of knowledge about the healthcare system, that's great!

Now, I complete around 90% of my work virtually. I go into the office a couple of days per month for tasks that require more face-to-face interaction. I want to continue working from home to use my current commute time to deliver more work and produce further results for my employer.

The interviewer wants to know that you can handle the often tricky balance associated with having an office inside of your home. It's a valid concern for employers when considering the introduction of a work-from-home role. \n\nYou want to show the interviewer that you work hard and are flexible with your time when needed, but you also want to avoid looking like a workaholic. Gone are the days where being a workaholic is a selling factor for employers. Most companies now agree that the workaholic mentality is an unhealthy practice that leads to burnout and high employee turnover. \n\nShow that you are cooperative and willing to do what it takes to get the job done without putting yourself into an agreement that you will regret. When you respond, be true to yourself and answer in a way that you can commit to, should you be hired.", "\"I am completely present during work hours, and outside of work hours, give my all to my family. However, I do work in the evenings and weekends when we need an extra push on a project. To ensure that I do not burn out or ever feel overwhelmed with my work volume, I keep a healthy balance by giving myself a dedicated lunch break where I take a walk outside and refresh my eyes from looking at the computer. On weekends, I turn email notifications off on my phone, but my boss is aware that she can reach me through text message if an emergency comes through. In short, I can jump into work whenever necessary while also being mindful of my need for personal rejuvenation.\""]}, {"topic": "Work+From+Home", "question": "Are you prepared to work with little face-to-face interaction with others?", "answers": ["Employees often romanticize the idea of working from home. In reality, they end up disliking the work-from-home setup and quitting their jobs. The interviewer wants to know that you have realistic expectations when working from home. \n\nAlthough technology can do incredible things, we are all social creatures who need personal connection. Even the most introverted people require face-to-face interaction now and then. Show the interviewer that you have done your research and that you understand working from home can feel a bit lonely at times. \n\nEveryone needs human interaction, so avoid brushing this question off in a way that shows you are completely okay with a lack of face-to-face opportunities. An 'I don't need to be around people' approach is unrealistic and will be a red flag for the interviewer. \n\nHighlight how you will cope with this reality and thrive in your new environment.

I am a social person, so to combat the potential loneliness, I will choose a video call over sending a string of emails when it's appropriate to do so. My current company has in-person meetups every quarter, and I make it a habit to attend those events. I also maintain a healthy social life on the weekends, which I find very fulfilling.

Now is not the time to be vague about your approach to communication!", "\"If I had a communication issue arise, the first thing I would do is pick up the phone and work the situation out. Whether the issue is with a supplier, a team member, or a client, I believe there is no replacement for a real-time voice conversation. One example of my communication skills in action is when I had a supplier cancel our order due to an inventory issue, just days before we were expecting it to arrive. The supplier sent a brief email that I felt was unapologetic and brief. Rather than sending a sharp email back, I picked up the phone and called the supplier. We did some collective troubleshooting, and I was able to make a small change to the order, which allowed us to receive a portion of the inventory right away, and the remainder two weeks later. Had I reacted out of impulse and gave the supplier an email in return, there would have been no opportunity to iron out the situation. I am a strong communicator and am willing to have a productive conversation at any time, rather than relying solely on email.\""]}]
