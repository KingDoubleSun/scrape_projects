I find this to be important at many levels of the organization because while there is a point of diminishing returns, the value of more accurate models corresponds to profit increases for the organization. When I use the Machine Learning model performance method, I start with a baseline model, and then I determine if the model skill is relative, and then assign a score to it. This method, in my opinion, is slightly better, but not by much. The biggest reasons are; mean outcome values for a regression and classification problem, and better input and output for forecasting.\"", "\"Predictive models as a whole are exciting to work with since you're dealing with both model accuracy and model performance. In my career working with data, I find that a machine learning model is directly correlated with the quality of the data provided by the sources in a company.

Adding a third dimension to make a 10 foot cubed area makes it all the more difficult to find the pin if placed within it.  In bringing this back to machine learning, my job is to somehow make the three dimensional field that the machine will pull from easier to pull from.  Last year, I was part of a team that developed a system for pulling public health data.

Companies everywhere use machine learning models to improve the way they do business. It helps companies make more precise business decisions based on the data they have. When developing a machine learning model, one has to rely on data that can be used to develop new products, and provide insights into business operations and decision making processes. \n\nInterviewers ask this question because they are interested in a few different things from you. The first thing is your opinion on the importance of model performance and model accuracy. Your opinion should not heavily discount one over the other since they're interested to hear if you have worked with both, and why you have a preference over one or the other. Give an example and explanations of why you think one is better than the other, and detail the features, processes or techniques that you feel work better for you or the company. You could mention that model accuracy is used for identifying relationships and patterns between variables in a dataset. Model performance can also be mentioned as calculating current values based on a prediction and comparing the model's performance.", "\"In my opinion, I believe that model performance and model accuracy have an equally important role to play in Machine Learning. When I work with model accuracy, I understand that the better the data is the better the outcome of the results will be. This data provides better predictions and insights that deliver more business value, and by optimizing model accuracy, it mitigates cost as well. I find this to be important at many levels of the organization because while there is a point of diminishing returns, the value of more accurate models corresponds to profit increases for the organization. When I use the Machine Learning model performance method, I start with a baseline model, and then I determine if the model skill is relative, and then assign a score to it. This method, in my opinion, is slightly better, but not by much. The biggest reasons are; mean outcome values for a regression and classification problem, and better input and output for forecasting.\"", "\"Predictive models as a whole are exciting to work with since you're dealing with both model accuracy and model performance. In my career working with data, I find that a machine learning model is directly correlated with the quality of the data provided by the sources in a company. As mentioned earlier, I believe both methods provide value to an organization. Some of the data quality issues I've come across using model accuracy are missing or erroneous values in a data set, categorical values that don't work well with textual values, data dimensions that are required to be reduced due to size, and lastly issues with scaling values and features.\"\""]}, {"topic": "Keyrus+SA", "question": "What questions do you have for me about Keyrus?", "answers": ["It's always a great idea to have questions ready for the interviewer.

Would you kindly list different types of imputation techniques, and which method you find to be most favorable for your environment?", "answers": ["There are multiple imputation methods that can be used for missing data. It comes down to the experience one has using imputation techniques. In most cases, your software by default chooses Listwise deletion. This, of course, all depends on why and how much data is missing. Another approach is imputation which means replacing data values with an estimate, then analyzing the data to see if imputed values were observed. \n\nA question like this is posed to help the hiring manager determine your level of expertise with imputation. First, start with an overview of your knowledge with imputation and imputation techniques. They will probably be looking for something along the lines of mean imputation and single or multiple imputations. The way to answer this question with relation to mean imputation is to talk about Regression Imputation, Hot Deck Imputation, Cold Deck Imputation, Substitution, Stochastic Regression Imputation, and Interpolation and Extrapolation. If a question comes up about single or multiple imputations, it's going to depend on unbiased parameter estimates and accurate standard errors.", "\"When I work on different types of imputation techniques, the goal I want to achieve is what missing information am I looking for, and what am I suppose to do with it. Every company has different rules about imputation policies, and how to handle missing data. In most cases, the software you use defaults to a listwize method of cleaning up unwanted, unused or missing data. It's important to look into how much data you are storing, and how much of that is usable data that the business can use. Some of the methods I use to determine single or multiple imputations are the following:\n\n1.\tHot Deck Imputation - (A missing value imputed from a random selection).\n2.\tCold Deck Imputation - (Same as hot-deck, but more advanced and selects from other datasets). \n3.\tMean Imputation - (Replacing missing values with predicted values). \n4.\tSingle Imputation - (Denotes that the missing value is replaced by a value).\"", "\"Working with missing data can be a challenge for most people, but I find this type of work very rewarding professionally. My role requires me to work with a team of data architects and consultants who provide me with data, and then I apply imputation techniques to cleanse the data so that the company can use it for managing and growing the operations. It is important that I obtain the best quality data before making it ready for the business to use. This is why I apply these types of imputation techniques. \n\n1.\tMultiple Imputation - (Estimates the values multiple times).\n2.\tRegression Imputation - (Involves replacing missing values with a predicted value).\n3.\tStochastic Regression - (Same as regression, but adds a common regression variance to the imputation).\""]}, {"topic": "Keyrus+SA", "question": "When dealing with data, in your opinion, is it better to have too many false positives, or too many false negatives? Please explain.", "answers": ["There has been much discussion and speculation about false positives and false negatives, and not all data scientists are in 100% agreement with what is interpreted as a false negative and false negative. Let's say for example you were diagnosed with not having a disease, but after numerous tests, it was verified and confirmed that the disease was in fact still present. That would be considered a false positive. If on the other hand you were diagnosed with a disease, but found out later that you didn't have a disease, which would be considered a false negative. In this type of interview situation, the hiring manager is looking for two things. Your opinion and explanation about false positives and false negatives when it comes to dealing with data management. \n\nData results can be misleading at times, and you need to be able to explain why this is the case, and in your opinion how the data is viewed negatively or positively based on whatever tests were run to arrive at the result from the data. It would help to offer your perspective to the interviewer on the way you determine whether you think it's better to have too many false positives or too many false negatives to sort out.", "\"The way I approach false negatives and false positives is to form a null hypothesis which leads you to try and reject it, thus giving me a positive result. I know that data scientists don't like the notion of swapping hypothesis, but they do give us situations where arriving at a false negative is not ideal. I've heard cases where false positives have had bad outcomes because of how the data was analyzed. Everything is not so Black and White. There are examples that have a hypothesis that cannot be switched due to the nature of science and law, which shows that errors are interchangeable. It comes down to how you design and research your study.\"", "\"Although false positives and false negatives have been debated on probably every topic available, it has been my experience that having too many false negatives over false positive results have been better for our work environment. Especially when you're dealing with something as sensitive as data. There are times when I run QA or validation tests on data, and depending on what we're looking at, we could get a false positive or false negative.

I take this data and put it in the correct silos of a data warehouse, then break it down into data points that have relevant and usable data that the business can understand and use it to make business decisions.

Adding a third dimension to make a 10 foot cubed area makes it all the more difficult to find the pin if placed within it.  In bringing this back to machine learning, my job is to somehow make the three dimensional field that the machine will pull from easier to pull from.  Last year, I was part of a team that developed a system for pulling public health data.
